RocketBoyBlue - A Complete Image Album Customer Portal in ASP.NET
======================================================================
This was written in roughly 2008 and runs a couple of my sites.  Its
old ASP.NET not MVC unfortunately.  Does use LINQ as the ORM and has some
references to 3rd Party Components.  This was built from scratch in
roughly 4 weeks.
======================================================================
In a nutshell, its a Photography portal which helps a Photographer manage
his/her Customers Albums, as well as display his own.  It provides for a
Customer Login and also allows for any Number of Albums to be displayed
on the Left Panel menu.  The Photographs are uploaded via a packaged
ZIP file which has a Manifest XML file.  The Administrator can configure
usernames and passwords as well as display the Albums of the Photographer.
For the most part is partially configurable, whatever that means.  Meaning
it was good enough for my needs at the time, and ran very reliably.
